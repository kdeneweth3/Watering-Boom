# Watering Boom README

See a video demostration here... https://youtu.be/3wBGWbtR-vk

This is a video of what a watering boom is and what I am trying to simulate. The one in the video moves based on programmed distances, mine adjusts speeds based on where magnets are placed... https://youtu.be/ybX9QwgMrn8

The solenoidValveControl is code to control a 12 volt solenoid valve with an arduino. This was to test if my circuit was setup correctly.
This will be very easy to replicate in python for the raspberry pi pins.
